					<h3>Why?</h3>
					<h4>Open Data in the World</h4>

					<p>Globally, the Open Data movement has grown tremendously over the past few years, gaining strong support from cities like New York and Philadelphia, the creation of a nationwide data.gov, and organizations like Code for America leading the charge.</p>

					<h4>Open Data on College Campuses</h4>

					<p>On the college front, student organizations (like <a href="http://labs.pennapps.com/">PennApps Labs at UPenn</a>, <a href="http://scottylabs.org/">ScottyLabs at Carnegie Mellon</a>, <a href="http://adicu.com/">ADI at Columbia</a>) have sprung up or evolved to encourage and help their universities share available data with students, encourage students to get involved with projects that rely on available data, and explore ways to use Open Source to improve the state of campus technology.  More and more on-campus technology is becoming student-created and student run.</p>

					<h4>Building Connections between Student Technology Organizations</h4>

					<p>However, there's little cross-school communication between these emerging student organizations.  Our goal is to bring organizational leadership together and find ways to share best practices as well as explore avenues for collaboration.</p>

					<h4>To Support Open Data and Open Source in the World</h4>

					<p>A strong college Campus Tech movement is important, because it means that more students get exposed to open data earlier in their careers.  It also gives students a chance to become comfortable contributing to Open Source projects earlier in their career by submitting patches to student-run tech.  All in all, a strong campus tech community is a tool of empowerment.</p>
